# Somepression
can i create my own image format? :thinking:

this crazy idea came to me, in development of GmodUltralight, because drawing solid color rectangles with any size much performant than one by one

# concept

compression - not a number, but enum

## maximum compression

split image by solid color rects, if color doesn't differ larger than 50% it's solid rectangle

# no compression

split image by solid color rects layers
